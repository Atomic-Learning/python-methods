<p>In Python, a <strong>method</strong> is a function that belongs to an object which allows you to access or modify its state.</p>

<h2>Method Syntax in Python</h2>

<p>You call methods using dot notation:</p>

<pre><code>object.method_name(arguments)</code></pre>

<p>For example (don't worry about the specific types of objects or what the methods do for now):</p>

<pre><code>my_list.append(5)           # Call append() method on my_list, pass 5 as an argument
my_string.upper()           # Call upper() method on my_string
my_dict.get("key")          # Call get() method on my_dict and pass "key" as an argument</code></pre>

Remember, even if a method doesn't require arguments, you still need to include the parentheses when calling it (e.g. <code class="language-python">my_string.upper()</code>, not <code class="language-python">my_string.upper</code>).

<h2>Methods Are Tied to Types</h2>

<p>Methods only exist for their specific type. You can't call a method that doesn't belong to the type of object:</p>

<py-cell>my_list = [1, 2, 3] # Create a list
my_string = "hello" # Create a string

my_list.append(4)           # Works - lists have append
print(my_list)

my_string.append("!")       # TypeError - strings don't have append</py-cell>
